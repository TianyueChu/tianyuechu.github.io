PIMCity is a European project that aims to build the next generation personal data platforms. The project is financed by the European Union H2020-ICT-2018-2020 (Information and Communication Technology) Grant. The project is a collaboration between 11 partners from 6 countries. The project started in January 2019 and will last for 3 years. The project aims to build a platform that will allow users to manage their personal data in a secure and privacy-preserving way. The platform will allow users to store their data in a secure way and to share their data with third parties in a privacy-preserving way. The platform will also provide users with tools to analyze their data and to gain insights from it. The platform will be built using state-of-the-art technologies in the areas of privacy-preserving data management, secure data sharing, and data analysis. 

My role in the project is to develop a privacy-preserving data sharing mechanism that allows users to share their data with third parties in a privacy-preserving way.  The mechanism provide users with tools to control who can access their data and how their data can be used. The mechanism will be integrated into the PIMCity platform and will be evaluated using real-world data and applications.
