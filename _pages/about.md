Welcome to my webpage!  I am Tianyue Chu, a final-year PhD candidate at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) and a Research Assistant at the IMDEA Networks Institute, Spain.
I have been fortunate to work under the guidance of Dr. [Nikolaos Laoutaris](https://laoutaris.info/), whose mentorship has been instrumental in shaping my research directions.

My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and distributed learning, with a particular focus on addressing the privacy and security implications in these domains. 
My research goal is to provide individuals with better control over their privacy, and protection from digital threats. 
I want to work towards a future where digital services are inherently designed with user privacy and security at the forefront.
