Welcome to my webpage!  I am Tianyue Chu, a final-year PhD candidate at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) and a Research Assistant at the IMDEA Networks Institute, Spain.
I have been fortunate to work under the guidance of Dr. Nikos Laoutaris, whose mentorship has been instrumental in shaping my research directions.

My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and distributed learning, with a particular focus on addressing the privacy and security implications in these domains. 
My research goal is to provide individuals with better control over their privacy, and protection from digital threats. 
I want to work towards a future where digital services are inherently designed with user privacy and security at the forefront.
