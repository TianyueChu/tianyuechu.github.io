PIMCity is a European project that aims to build the next generation personal data platforms. The project is financed by the European Union H2020-ICT-2018-2020 (Information and Communication Technology) Grant. The project is a collaboration between 11 partners from 6 countries. The project started in January 2019 and will last for 3 years. The project aims to build a platform that will allow users to manage their personal data in a secure and privacy-preserving way. The platform will allow users to store their data in a secure way and to share their data with third parties in a privacy-preserving way. The platform will also provide users with tools to analyze their data and to gain insights from it. The platform will be built using state-of-the-art technologies in the areas of privacy-preserving data management, secure data sharing, and data analysis.
