ProperData is an NSF SaTC Frontiers project whose goal is to improve data transparency and privacy, using a joint tech-policy approach.  This NSF SaTC Frontier center aims to address the urgent need for protection of personal data flow on the Internet. We bring together a multidisciplinary team of outstanding researchers that will build fundamentals, create new technologies, and inform policy, so as to improve the transparency and control of personal data, for the coming decade

I participate in the project to join the team of researchers to discuss and develop new technologies and policies to improve the transparency and control of personal data. I also give the talk on the project at the [ProperData website](https://properdata.eng.uci.edu/).
