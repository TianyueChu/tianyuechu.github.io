excerpt: "In this paper, we consider the estimation problem for partially linear models with additive measurement errors in the nonparametric part. Two kinds of estimators are proposed. The first one is an integral moment-based estimator with deconvolution kernel techniques, associated with the strong consistency for the estimator. Another one is a simulation-based estimator to avoid the integrals involved in the integral moment-based estimator. Simulation studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed estimators."

In this paper, we consider the estimation problem for partially linear models with additive measurement errors in the nonparametric part. Two kinds of estimators are proposed. The first one is an integral moment-based estimator with deconvolution kernel techniques, associated with the strong consistency for the estimator. Another one is a simulation-based estimator to avoid the integrals involved in the integral moment-based estimator. Simulation studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed estimators.
