Through DataBri-X, European Data Spaces, platforms and marketplaces and their wide range of business, governmental and public, research and civil society stakeholders will be equipped with a holistic and flexible data governance process and a seamless integrated standards based toolbox for data- and metadata management which can be assembled along relevant requirements, provides open source as well as commercial tools (the bricks / bri-X), and mechanisms to load 3rd party resources like language resources or AI models, and can be easily deployed into Data Spaces and thereby will contribute to make Europe the most successful area in the world in terms of data sharing and data re-use, to gain the full benefit from the value of data, while respecting the legal framework relating to security and privacy. The projectâ€™s objective is to provide a holistic, energy-efficient and user-friendly toolbox of practical, robust and scalable bricks/Bri-X (processes, technologies and tools) that improve the interoperability, usability, discoverability, quality, and integrity of data and metadata, with the aim of making data sets ready for expanded digital value creation in the context of European Data Spaces. The DataBri-X toolbox will be offered in compliance with accountability, fairness, privacy, and confidentiality regulations as well as FAIR principles and will build on existing and emerging initiatives. The DataBri-X consortium comprises 14 partners from 6 EU members and 1 associated country (UK), that together form a complete value chain of actors.

My role in the project is to lead the work package on data quality and metadata management, and to contribute to the development of the DataBri-X toolbox.
